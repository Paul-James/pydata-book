PYDATA-BOOK README

This is a fork of the repo by Wes McKinney for his book (published by O'Reilly Media), Python For Data Analysis.
The repo contains data files from the chapters of the book.
I plan on using these examples as sandboxes for various other things that specifically apply to me.
The examples in the repo are organized by book chapter number.
